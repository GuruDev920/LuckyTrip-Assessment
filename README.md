## Install
Please install pod before build the project.

You can install the pod by executing the command of 'pod install' in root folder.

Please open the file *.xcworkspace.

## Run
At first picker screen, you can search destinations by search keyword for country or city.
After search, you can sort the result by country names or city names.

You can see the video if it has by clicking play button at the center of thumbnail.

Once selected over 3 items in result, you can save them and will go to selected screen.
When the app reopen after saved, it is showing previous selected destinations.

In api result, there is no names in Destinations, so I showed just iata code in selected screen.
